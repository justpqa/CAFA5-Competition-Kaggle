# CAFA5-Competition-Kaggle

This is my notebook for submission to the CAFA 5 Protein Function Prediction, where I got to use my Machine Learning and Data Preprocessing knowledge to predict GO (genetic ontology) terms of 140000+ protein sequences. 

My progress:
+ Use protein component percentage of all proteins for features and Naive Bayes combined with Binary Relevance for multilabel classification, got a score of 0.23998
+ Use protein embeddings of all proteins for feature and Deep Neural Network for predictions

Current roadmap:
+ Find other way to improve the model for prediction using component percentage (other multilabel technique or ML models)
+ Create and make a submission using neural network for protein embeddings
+ Find other features that can be useful.
